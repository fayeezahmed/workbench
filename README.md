# Workbench

This repo contains my standard tools so that I don't have to remember what I have to install each time on a new machine.

## Tools
* Vim
* Zshrc
* Tmux

## Start ZSH
To start zsh, use the following command:
* `zsh`

If you want to start it automatically, add this to your .bashrc:
```
# Launch ZSH automatically:
if [ -t 1 ]; then
    exec zsh
fi
```

### Install oh-my-zsh
You may have to install oh-my-zsh again if your terminal looks off, do this: 
`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

Once you've done this, make sure you checkout the latest .zsh from this master since the above install will overwrite the file.

#### Install zsh-syntax-highlighting
Do the following:
`git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting $HOME/`

### fshow()
